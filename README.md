Modular Backbone Project Template
=================================

This project is heavily (and I mean heavily) inspired by the work of Thomas Davis and his
[Organizing your application using Modules (require.js)](http://backbonetutorials.com/organizing-backbone-using-modules/) tutorial.

Aim of this project is to provide minimalistic structure of the Backbone project using RequireJS that is containing up-to-date libraries and
is immediately ready for the implementation. This version contains neither sample implementation nor stylesheets and other assets.

If you want to have a look at the slightly different version of this project containing simple example implementation
have a look [here](https://github.com/dzejkej/backbonetutorials/tree/gh-pages/examples/modular-backbone-updated).
